## Getting Started with Runable Workflows

Learn how to create and save your first automation workflow in Runable. This guide will walk you through the complete process from initial chat to workflow execution.

## Step 1 - Start a Chat with Runable

Begin by opening Runable and starting a conversation. Simply type your automation request in natural language.

**Example prompts:**
- "Check my calendar for meetings today and research the companies"
- "Get the latest PRs from our GitHub repo and post updates to Slack"
- "Analyze our Discord support channel and create a weekly report"
- "Monitor our website uptime and send alerts to our team"

<Tip>

Be specific about what you want to automate. The more detailed your prompt, the better Runable can understand your requirements and suggest the right connectors.

</Tip>

## Step 2 - Connect Required Apps

Runable will identify which of our 2700+ apps and services you need to connect for your workflow.

<Tip>

You only need to connect each app once. Runable will remember your connections for future workflows. With 2700+ connectors available, you can automate almost any process.

</Tip>

## Step 3 - Refine Through Chat

Continue the conversation with Runable to:

- **Clarify requirements** - Specify exactly what you want to achieve
- **Add more steps** - Expand the workflow with additional actions
- **Modify parameters** - Adjust timing, frequency, or output format
- **Test the workflow** - See how it performs before saving

<Tip>

The chat interface is where you'll do most of your workflow customization. Be conversational and specific about your needs.

</Tip>

## Step 4 - Save Your Workflow

Once you're satisfied with your workflow setup:

1. **Click "Save Workflow"** in the interface
2. **Enter workflow details:**
   - **Workflow Name**: Give your workflow a descriptive name (e.g., "Daily Meeting Research")
   - **Description**: Explain what the workflow does and its purpose
   - **Input Parameters**: Define what inputs the workflow needs (e.g., company names, date ranges, channel IDs)
   - **Expected Output**: Describe what the workflow will produce (e.g., research reports, notifications, data files)
   - **Tags**: Add tags for easy organization (e.g., "sales", "research", "daily")
3. **Click "Submit"** to save

### Example Workflow Details

**Workflow Name:** Daily Sales Meeting Research

**Description:** Automatically checks my calendar for company meetings, researches each company and attendees, compiles findings into markdown files, and updates meeting notes with research links.

**Input Parameters:** 
- Calendar date range (default: today)
- Research depth (basic/advanced)
- Output format (markdown/Google Docs)

**Expected Output:**
- Company research files (.md format)
- Updated calendar meeting notes

**Tags:** sales, research, meetings, automation

<Tip>

Detailed workflow information helps Runable understand exactly what to do and makes it easier for you and your team to manage workflows later.

</Tip>

## Step 5 - Manage Your Workflow

After saving, you have several options for running your workflow:

### Run Options

### Workflow Management
